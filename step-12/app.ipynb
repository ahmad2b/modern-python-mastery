The stabilization of economic \\nand political affairs paves the way for reinforcing \\nfriendly relations based on mutual interests with a \\nwide range of trade partners. Trade is thus one of \\nthe most important forms of exchange between \\ncountries and fostering this will lead to connections \\nsuch as foreign investments, better employment \\nopportunities, and scientific and technical ex -\\nchanges, all of which will contribute to Pakistan’s \\ngrowth and prosperity.\\nThe Government of Pakistan has taken a series \\nof initiatives to promote exports to achieve sus -\\ntainable and inclusive economic growth, poverty \\nreduction and improvement in the living standard \\nof the Pakistani people. This is also aligned with \\nthe government’s vision of the Strategic Trade \\nPolicy Framework (  STPF  ) 2020–25 for ‘Pakistan \\nto become a dynamic and efficient domestic \\nmarket as well as a globally competitive export-\\ndriven economy’. In this context, the Ministry of \\nCommerce supported the preparation of the \\nSoftware Development Export Strategy, a priority \\nexport sector under the STPF, which will bring vis -\\nible benefits to the economy of the country and \\ngenerate tremendous employment opportunities. \\nThis sector export strategy has been formulated \\nwith close consultation of all the stakeholders; \\nand the Ministry of Commerce appreciates all \\nthose involved in the process, particularly the  \\nprivate sector.\\nAs a priority export product within the frame -\\nwork of the STPF 2020–25, the software sector \\npresents a new export avenue and an opportunity \\nfor Pakistan. The strategy encompasses coun -\\ntry’s existing strengths, constraints, and foresee -\\nable potentials in this sector. All activities in the \\nframework of designing Strategies has outlined \\na detailed 5-year Plan of Action to tackle issues \\nand facilitate export procedures, and as identified by all the stakeholders of the Software sector in \\nPakistan.\\nDespite challenges in the international trade \\nscenario and the global business environment, \\nI am confident that this initiative will serve as an \\naction-oriented blueprint to enhance trade per -\\nformance and develop a coordinated mechanism \\nwith participation from both the public and private \\nsector, increasing its competitiveness in the inter -\\nnational market.\\nTo maintain the momentum sparked by the con -\\nsultations, the Ministry of Commerce is committed \\nto play constructive and facilitative role, while mak -\\ning it our top-priority to execute the activities and \\nreforms proposed in the Plan of Action in consul -\\ntations with the stakeholders. We are particularly \\ncommitted to continue keeping the private sector \\nin the driving seat for the implementation process \\nthrough the Sector Specific Council on Information \\nTechnology. The Government of Pakistan is fully \\ncommitted to promoting export-led economic \\ngrowth and would encourage all to join hands and \\nwork together in making the vision of a flourishing \\nSoftware sector a reality.',\n",
       " 'iii\\nMessage from Pakistan Software  \\nHouses Association ( P@SHA )\\nAs the representatives of Pakistan’s information \\ntechnology ( IT ) and IT-enabled services ( ITeS ) \\nsector, we were pleased to see that the Strategic \\nTrade Policy Framework Review ( STPF ) 2020-25 \\nhas identified the IT software exports sector as a \\npriority focus export sector for growth and devel -\\nopment for the next five years. This builds on the \\nimpressive gains made by our industry in a short \\nperiod of time, amid unprecedented domestic and \\nglobal challenges.\\nEspecially as the COVID-19 crisis gripped the \\nglobal economy, the demand for the services \\nprovided by our member firms have been rapidly \\ngrowing and Pakistan’s reputation for delivery of \\nglobal services is increasing. As a strong industry \\nvoice that has lobbied with the government to initi -\\nate policies and create an environment that would \\nattract more firms to join the industry, we remain \\ncommitted to supporting this strategy’s implemen -\\ntation, towards improving sectoral competitiveness \\nand global expansion.\\nHaving grown from a nascent industry to a \\nprominent service export sector in a short time-\\nframe, there are now several key issues that re -\\nquire addressing in order to reach the next growth \\nwave. These include improving the sector’s global \\npositioning, tackling certain regulatory and policy \\nbottlenecks, improving investor attractiveness, ag -\\ngressively promoting in key growth markets, en -\\nhancing the skilled talent pool and strengthening \\nfirms’ internal delivery capabilities, to name a few.\\nThe industry has been increasing its presence in \\nregional and international markets. Through imple -\\nmentation of key actions envisaged in this strategy, \\nwe expect to strengthen global market penetration, \\nin existing and new segments. Notably, the strate -\\ngy also puts forward activities to improve firm-level \\ncapabilities in the sector, so that software services exporters can be more competitive, more innova -\\ntive, more productive and more competent.\\nUnsurprisingly, our surveys have shown that IT \\nsector jobs tend to be higher paid than other ex -\\nport jobs. As such, we believe that, by delivering \\non this strategy’s goals, the industry can play a \\ncatalytic role in Pakistan’s economic transforma -\\ntion through the creation of good jobs. Even while \\nthis is a vision, the shortage of skilled workers is \\na key risk to current and future growth. As such, it \\nis essential to accelerate efforts to improve both \\ntechnical/hard skills and soft skills. We recog -\\nnize the strategy’s focus on addressing this, and \\ncommit to working with public and private stake -\\nholders to implement feasible and time-bound \\nprogrammes.\\nMeanwhile, our industry is a pioneer in recog -\\nnizing the importance of diversity and inclusion. \\nHaving published a framework report in 2021, we \\nlook forward to accelerating efforts to improve our \\nfirms’ commitment to this agenda, as it will not only \\nserve domestic stakeholders well, but will also be \\na key differentiator in international markets.\\nThis strategy provides an excellent roadmap for \\nthe sector’s future growth, with a focus on qual -\\nity, competitiveness, innovation and export market \\nexpansion. We welcome recent government initia -\\ntives to improve the framework conditions for our \\nsector’s growth. Coupled with the measures in this \\nstrategy and the private sector’s tenacity, we are \\nconfident of a bright future for the sector.\\nAs digitalization takes hold across nearly every \\nsector globally, Pakistan’s software industry stands \\nready to be a dominant player in the region and \\ndeliver impressive growth performance through \\nexports, capitalizing on emerging trends while \\ncontinuing to strengthen current competencies.\\n \\nBadar Khushnood,  \\nChairman, P@SHA\\n',\n",

       " 'v\\nNote for the reader\\nIn order to boost export growth, the Ministry of Commerce ( MoC ) has developed \\nthe Strategic Trade Policy Framework ( STPF ) 2020-25, which was approved in \\nNovember 2021. ITC provided technical support to MoC and the Trade Develop -\\nment Authority of Pakistan ( TDAP ) to design selected sector export strategies \\nof the STPF priority sectors. This initiative, called the National Priority Sectors \\nExport Strategy (  NPSES  ), focused on 10 of the 18 STPF priority sectors through \\na consultative process.\\nThe Software Development Export Strategy was developed based on a partici -\\npatory approach, during which more than 30 Pakistani industry leaders, small \\nbusiness owners and public sector representatives held consultations to reach \\nconsensus on key sector competitiveness issues and priority activities. These \\ninclusive consultations were held in a hybrid model owing to the travel restrictions \\nimposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nBesides in-depth qualitative and quantitative research and service map analysis, \\nthese consultations were complemented by visits and interviews by the national \\nconsultants with domestic firms to guide the strategy with insights and market \\nintelligence.\\nThe Software Development Export Strategy builds on the ongoing initiatives \\nin areas of private sector development, regional integration, investment and \\neconomic empowerment of youth. Equally importantly, the sector strategy is \\ncomplemented by an effort to establish the proper implementation responsi -\\nbilities among key stakeholders early on to ensure timely implementation of \\nactivities, whether by the public sector, private sector or international develop -\\nment agencies. This strategy’s principal output is an endorsed, coherent and \\ncomprehensive document with a five-year detailed plan of action ( PoA ) and an \\nimplementation management framework.\\nThis document was approved as the official export strategy for the Software \\nSector 2023-2027 by the Software Sector Specific Council and endorsed by the \\nMinistry of Commerce of Pakistan.',\n",

It is a five-year endeavour that was defined through a consultative \\nprocess between public and private sector stakeholders. The strategy addresses constraints in a \\ncomprehensive manner and defines concrete opportunities that can be realized through the specific \\nsteps detailed in its plan of action ( PoA ). The Software Development Export Strategy is an integral \\npart of Pakistan’s Strategic Trade Policy Framework ( STPF ).\\nPakistan’s information technology ( IT ) and IT-enabled \\nservices ( ITeS ) sector’s recent advancement points to \\na strong export potential in the medium term, lever -\\naging the available talent pool, financial attractiveness \\nand existing market entry to major importing locations. \\nIn particular, Pakistan’s software sector has many of \\nthe fundamentals in place to drive faster growth, and \\nthe rapid rise in export earnings already seen in recent \\nyears is a sign of future prospects. Building on from \\nthis would require tackling some key challenges to \\ngrowth and competitiveness.\\nThe acceleration of digitalization, further spurred by the \\ndramatic shifts brought on by COVID-19, indicate bright \\nprospects for the global IT services industry. This pro -\\nvides ample opportunity for Pakistan, with an already \\ndynamic sector, to leverage this growth and become a \\nleading software services player for regional and global \\nclients. As industry and government stakeholders ac -\\nknowledge, Pakistan’s IT services sector has many of \\nthe fundamentals in place to drive faster growth.\\nThe strategy process considered current capabilities, \\nconstraints, and future shifts and opportunities for \\nPakistan’s software sector, and industry stakeholders \\nextensively evaluated future orientations and upgrad -\\ning trajectories. During the strategy consultations and \\nbackground research, it was revealed that, even as the \\nsector faces new pressures, some compelling residual \\nassets for Pakistan would include the availability of \\naffordable talent, high interest among young people \\nin the industry ( including from non-IT backgrounds ), \\ncontinued venture capital interest and continued interest by joint venture partners. Meanwhile, some \\ncompelling strategic future shifts for Pakistan’s indus -\\ntry – latching on to current trends and innovations –  \\nwould include  :\\n• Technology and digital transformation consulting  ;\\n• Collaborating between larger firms and small and \\nmedium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) to deliver larger \\nprojects  ;\\n• More women in IT ;\\n• Strengthening exports in new markets ( e.g. Africa ) ;\\n• Productivity-based remuneration  ;\\n• Remote infrastructure monitoring and support ser -\\nvices  ;\\n• More local firms listing on the stock market ;\\n• More mobile applications  ;\\n• Greater emphasis on software products, not just \\nservices  ;\\n• Digital banking and cashless society providing new \\nproduct opportunities.\\nBy solving some of the key competitiveness and \\ngrowth constraints, Pakistan’s IT sector and its soft -\\nware firms can position strongly for export growth. It \\nis necessary to set some strategic objectives for the \\nshort to medium term to drive sector transformation, \\nand prioritize some key actions. In particular, it will be \\nessential for Pakistan to :\\n• Build a strong pipeline of tertiary educated and ap -\\npropriately skilled workers while enhancing women’s \\nparticipation  ;\\n• Resolve taxation issues related to sector definition ;',\n",

The strategy’s PoA responds to this vision by addressing the sector’s constraints and lever -\\naging opportunities comprehensively. To this end, \\nspecific efforts will be made in the following strategic \\ndirections.\\n•\\nDevelop\\na\\ncompelling\\nbrand\\nfor\\nPakistan\\nIT\\nto\\nstrengthen\\ninternational\\npositioning,\\nand\\nto\\naccelerate\\nexport\\nfirms'\\nmarket\\ndiversification\\nand\\ncommercial\\nsuccess\\nabroad\\n.\\nStrategic Objective 1: Strengthen Pakistan’s \\nsoftware sector’s global market positioning and \\ninternational competitiveness\\n•\\nExpand\\nthe\\ntalent\\npipeline\\nwith\\nan\\neye\\non\\ninclusiveness,\\nwhile\\nalso\\nimproving\\nfirm\\n-\\nlevel\\nmanagerial\\nand\\ntechnical\\ncompetencies\\nto\\ndrive\\ncompetitiveness\\nand\\nquality\\n.\\nStrategic Objective 2: Improve talent availability \\nfor growth and competitiveness\\n•\\nImprove\\ntax\\nframeworks\\nand\\nstreamline\\ncompliance\\ncomplexities,\\nand\\nimprove\\naccess\\nto\\ncapital\\nfor\\nsoftware\\nfirms\\n.\\nStrategic Objective 3: Improve business climate \\nfor software firms to compete and grow\\n•\\nEncourage\\nnew\\ninvestment\\nin\\nthe\\nsector\\n(including\\nfostering\\nstart\\n-\\nups)\\nand\\nimprove\\nthe\\nenabling\\nframework\\nto\\ndrive\\nproduct\\n-\\nled\\ninnovation\\n.\\nStrategic Objective 4: Strengthen innovation \\nand upgrading in the software sector\\nIMPLEMENTATION MANAGEMENT\\nThis strategy has developed a pragmatic and for -\\nward-looking roadmap for upgrading and international -\\nization. To achieve the strategy’s targets, stakeholders \\nwill need to coordinate actions, monitor progress and \\nmobilize resources for its implementation. Providing \\nbusiness development support to firms, enhancing \\ninnovation and creating an enabling business environ -\\nment are crucial for successful implementation.\\nAccordingly, a public–private sector specific council \\nfor the software industry is established, operational -\\nized and empowered. The software sector specific \\ncouncil should be responsible for overall coordination, provision of rapid solutions to regulatory and procedur -\\nal bottlenecks, policy guidance and the monitoring of \\nindustry development against the strategy’s strategic \\nobjectives.\\nThe following key areas of intervention are priorities to \\nfacilitate the strategy’s implementation  :\\n• Improve and increase the pipeline or talent ;\\n• Resolve, on an ongoing basis, tax and other regula -\\ntory issues ;\\n• Strengthen international exposure, branding and ex -\\nport market entry ;\\n• Foster a conducive climate for product develop -\\nment, innovation and start-up entrepreneurship.\",\n",

Telecommunications, computer \\nand information services have experienced increasing \\nexport value and are now the largest and fastest-grow -\\ning services exports globally (  Figure 2  ). While financial \\nservices also show up as a prominent services sector, \\nit must be acknowledged that, increasingly, the finan -\\ncial services industry is powered by information and \\ncommunications technology (  ICT ) services and the \\ngrowing fintech industry.  Exports of computer services \\nhave accounted for a small, but growing share of total \\nservices exports. Despite a drop from 3.5 % in 2007 \\nto 2.8  % in 2008, the share of exports from computer \\nservices has seen an increasing trend from the 3.1 % \\nlevel of 2005 to 9.5 % in 2020 (  Figure 3  ).\\nFigure 2 :  Growth in global services exports ( 2019 )\\nSources : ITC, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and World Trade Organization ( WTO )  \\ntrade in services database based on International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) statistics.\\n©shutterstock',\n",

       " '6\\nPakistan Export Strategy 2023-2027 • SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\\nIn 2020, the global IT industry took a small step back \\nin terms of overall revenue. While the tech sector fared \\nbetter than many other industries during the pandemic, \\nit was not immune to cutbacks in spending patterns \\nand deferment of major investments. In August 2020, \\nthe Industrial Development Corporation (  IDC ) project -\\ned global revenue of $4.8 trillion for the year, compared \\nto their original estimate of $5.2 trillion. Moving forward, \\nthe IDC projected that the technology industry would \\nreach $5 trillion in 2021. This would represent 4.2 % \\ngrowth, signalling a return to the trend line that the \\nindustry was on prior to the pandemic. Looking even \\nfurther into the future, the IDC expects the pattern to \\ncontinue, estimating a 5  % compound annual growth \\nrate ( CAGR ) for the industry through 2024.\\nIt is also useful to know which markets show the \\ngreatest demand for ICT imports. The United States remains the top destination, while China and the \\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (  ASEAN ) re-\\ngional markets are in the Top 5 markets for ICT demand \\n( Figure 5  ). This should be of strong consideration for \\nPakistan’s industry, given the strong track record of \\ntechnology sector linkages with the United States, but \\nalso the emerging partnerships with China and other \\nAsian countries. Robust infrastructure and platforms, a \\nlarge installed base of users equipped with connected \\ndevices, and available bandwidth for these devices to \\ncommunicate are at a more mature stage in the United \\nStates than any other country, hence paving the way for \\nsuch dominance. Studies reveal that the economic im -\\npact of the US tech sector, measured as a percentage \\nof gross domestic product, exceeds that of most other \\nindustries, including notable sectors such as retail, \\nconstruction and transportation ( Cyberstates, 2021 ).\\nFigure 5 :  Leading markets for ICT imports ( Top 10 + Association of Southeast Asian Nations )\\n40,4\\n36,6\\n23,8\\n23,1\\n20,3\\n18,1\\n16,4\\n15,9\\n15,5\\n15\\n10,6United States of America\\nGermany\\nChina\\nASEAN\\nFrance\\nNetherlands\\nUnited Kingdom\\nSwitzerland\\nJapan\\nSingapore\\nBelgium\\nSources : ITC, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) and World Trade Organization ( WTO ) trade in services database \\nbased on International Monetary Fund (  IMF ) statistics.\\nAmong the other global regions, Western Europe \\nremains a significant contributor, accounting for ap -\\nproximately one of every five technology dollars spent \\nworldwide ( IT Industry Outlook, 2021 ). Furthermore, as \\nfar as individual countries go, China has established \\nitself as a major player in the global tech market. China has followed a pattern that can be seen in developing \\nregions, where there is a twofold effect of closing the \\ngap in categories such as IT infrastructure, software \\nand services, along with staking out leadership po -\\nsitions in emerging areas such as robotics and 5G \\n( Figure 6  ).',\n",

       " '10\\nPakistan Export Strategy 2023-2027 • SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\\nBox 1 :  Key trends and outlook for the IT industry ( 2021 )\\n• Online storage :  By offering information technologies as a service, cloud computing and online storage is an innovative \\nbusiness model that can reduce organizations’ upfront and maintenance costs of adopting digital solutions, and can offer \\nflexible infrastructure. These traits can make cloud services particularly attractive and relevant to SMEs. Investments in \\ncloud technology, security and risk, networks and mobility are on the priority list for every chief information officer in 2021. \\nAs companies place more of their IT architecture in the cloud and consider new options for their workforce, networking \\nperformance becomes more critical. A key highlight is the new space created to support and maintain this service to keep \\nsystems running without down time.\\n• Customer focus : Customer retention will take precedence above all and, as per Forrester™, chief marketing officers would \\nincrease 30 % of their spending on loyalty and retention marketing. Investments and focus on customer service through an \\nefficient call centre will increase through this drive.\\n• Digital nomads  : Work from anywhere became the norm in 2021, with a staggering growth of 300  %. Office space could \\nbe a thing of the past. The majority of resources and the next generation workforce would set into a work-from-anywhere \\nbusiness environment, with gig culture1 settling in for good. The trend would expand new opportunities for the freelance \\nworkforce across the world.\\n• Security and compliance : With remote working becoming the standard trend, cybersecurity, and managing risks and compli -\\nance, need innovative approaches to proactively test the defences and internal processes that create secure operations. \\nSecurely managing the data and responding appropriately poses new challenges that require systems checks and tighter \\ncontrols to safeguard and protect companies and individuals from cyberattacks. An increase in skills and resources for \\ncyber competencies is a key area that Pakistan should consider as a top priority to harness the upcoming opportunities.\\n• Privacy rules :  Regulatory and legal activity related to employee privacy infringements will double. While European regulators \\nare already enforcing privacy rules to protect employees’ personal data, countries such as Brazil, India and the Kingdom \\nof Thailand will soon follow suit. Educating and spreading awareness on privacy policies and rights, primarily to Pakistan’s \\nfreelance workforce, would be crucial. In addition, having a regulatory framework protecting these individual rights should \\nbe considered.\\n• Cybersecurity frameworks  : The Asia-Pacific region will finally catch up on zero trust adoption. Zero trust adoption in the \\nregion has lagged behind its global peers, but the acceleration of cloud adoption and an explosion in remote work, as well \\nas changing regulations and consumer behaviours, make it ripe for change. It was predicted that at least one government \\nin the region would embrace a zero-trust cybersecurity framework in 2021.\\n• Data dominance :  Data analytics and data mining can improve monitoring, diagnostic and analytical processes in a wide \\nrange of activities across society and the economy, including computer science, statistics, mathematics and logistics. In \\naddition to new methods lowering costs in data collection and storage, it includes approaches for solving problems through \\nthe pre-processing, modelling, testing and reporting of data. The integration of data analytics and data mining into organiza -\\ntions’ processes allows for improved flexibility and responsiveness, in addition to reduced costs in businesses processes.\\nSource : CompTIA’s IT Industry Outlook 2021.

Customers are now increasingly shift -\\ning towards seeking cost plus value arbitrage, from \\noutsourcing business models that have traditionally \\nrelied only on cost arbitrage to survive and grow. Due \\nto this change, companies in the Pakistani IT sector \\nare required to have a sophisticated view of the market and leap into offering outcome-based, ‘cost plus val -\\nue’-based service offerings –  as opposed to developing \\nservices to cater to the existing view of the outsourcing \\nmarket.

Regardless \\nof whether a country is already a successful exporter, the index aims to assess the country’s fundamental competitiveness as a location for export \\nof knowledge services, based on four broad factors : financial attractiveness, people skills and availability, business environment, and digital \\nreadiness.Pakistani software sector leveraging  \\nits comparative advantages\\nPakistan’s IT sector has a promising future, brimming \\nwith talent and strong potential to become the coun -\\ntry’s largest export industry. The sector accounts for a \\ngrowing contribution to gross domestic product ( GDP ) \\nof close to 1  %, earning valuable foreign exchange for \\nthe country and creating high-paying jobs. In recent \\ndecades, revenue from the sector increased rapidly, \\nfrom just $70 million in 2006 to approximately $220 \\nmillion in 2011 and nearly $2,000 million today. In the \\npast decade, growth averaged 14 % CAGR per year. \\nThis indicates that, while the sector is still in its early \\nstages, its growth trajectory displays huge potential. \\nThe sector has also remained resilient during the pan -\\ndemic. According to the 2021 Commonwealth Trade \\nReview ( July 2021 ), ‘Pakistan’s service exports showed \\na strong resilience during the Covid-19 pandemic … \\nby September 2020 Pakistan’s services exports had \\nalready rebounded to December 2019 levels ( despite \\nfalling by 20pc in April 2020 )’.\\nThe growth and potential of the IT and ITeS sector, \\nand digital economy generally, have been supported \\nby government policy and investment in infrastructure. \\nThe significant investment in ICT infrastructure includes \\nmore than 16 IT parks with IT-enabled infrastructure \\nand state-of-the-art facilities, as well as spreading \\ninternet access in more than 2,000 cities and towns \\nacross Pakistan. The sector now has greater recogni -\\ntion in planning and policy development, with many pro-investment policy initiatives aimed at the sector \\nintroduced in national budgets.\\nKEY FUNDAMENTALS ARE IN PLACE\\nEngagement in high-value-added segments remains \\nnascent albeit highly sophisticated, with some com -\\npanies exporting digital technologies for large indus -\\ntries in the United States such as oil and gas and \\nhealthcare.\\nDespite some areas of weakness, Pakistan ranks \\namong the Top 50 jurisdictions ( Rank 31 ) worldwide \\nin the 2021 Global Services Location Index ( GSLI ),1 a \\nmeasure of competitiveness as a location for export \\nof ICT and other knowledge services. On the pillar of \\n‘financial attractiveness’ in the GSLI, Pakistan is scored \\nthe second-most financially attractive location in the \\nworld for offshoring IT–BPO services ( Kearney, 2021 ). \\nMoreover, in the low-end BPO segment, operational \\ncosts are 60 % lower than in the Philippines, which is \\noften seen as the world’s customer support power -\\nhouse. This edge is favoured by the low competition \\nfor labour in Pakistan, due to the sector’s relative im -\\nmaturity (  Figure 13  ).',\n",

Particularly, \\nit boasts a trainable and competent workforce, most \\nof which (  60 % of the total population of 200 million ) \\nis aged 15–29. This represents an enormous human \\nand knowledge capital to drive the IT sector. Approx -\\nimately 20,000 IT graduates and engineers are be -\\ning produced each year. Pakistan is also the world’s \\nthird-largest English-speaking country after the United \\nStates ( 1st ) and India (  2nd ). Approximately 49 % of the \\npopulation speaks English as a second language ; i.e. \\n94.3 million people ( Couto & Fernandez-Stark, 2019 ). \\nAn added advantage – especially for customer-cen -\\ntric services – is that Pakistani IT workers’ English pro -\\nnunciation is relatively more neutral than in competitor \\ncountries.FEMALE PARTICIPATION IN THE SECTOR\\nGender dynamics play a significant role in the availabil -\\nity of appropriate skill to meet the industry’s labour de -\\nmands. Compared to developed economies, Pakistan \\nfeatures a slightly lower share of female workers in IT, \\nwhich is remarkable given the global bias towards male \\nprofessionals in the field of technology. However, par -\\nticipation of females in IT studies and IT employment \\nremains low and is rooted in concerns for safety, mo -\\nbility restrictions and traditional family roles. One key \\nfactor pertaining to the underemployment of women \\nis the commute to work ; the inadequate transporta -\\ntion system is of such significance that females might \\nignore better job opportunities and go for lower-paid, \\nlow-skill jobs. Only 15 % of women make up the total \\nemployment in software services, which is the largest \\nsegment in Pakistan’s information technology sector \\n( Table 3 ).

These are based on \\nstakeholder consultations.\\nSUPPLY-SIDE AND INPUTS LEVEL\\nTalent shortages, employability and brain drain\\n• The current talent pipeline is insufficient for the \\nsector’s growth needs. Pakistan needs an annual \\nsupply of 100,000 IT graduates, while it is currently \\napproximately 20,000. Estimates suggest that the \\ntotal talent pool currently available for the sector is \\nroughly 75,000 high school graduates and 25,000 \\nuniversity graduates. This shortage will particular -\\nly affect SMEs and start-ups in the sector, unlike \\nlarge firms that can have various talent attraction \\nschemes. Consequently, it will affect the sector’s in -\\nclusive development.• The incoming talent is not sufficiently focused on \\nemerging technologies. Talent development and \\nuniversity programmes focus on technology skills \\nrelated to immediate market needs as opposed to \\nemerging markets around AI, big data / analytics, ro -\\nbotics, IoT and fintech. As an industry player noted, \\n‘Pakistani IT firms are mostly playing catch up to \\ncutting-edge US, EU, Chinese and Japanese firms \\nand are lagging behind by 15 years’.\\n• There is also a question of employability of talent. \\nThe employability rate across the sub-segments in \\nthe IT and ITeS services industry remains relatively \\nlow at 30 % and 50 % for high school graduates and \\nIT graduates (  Tier II-III universities  ) respectively. \\nThe government has initiated some programmes \\nfor skill development, but reportedly they do not \\nattract quality talent and do not result in employ -\\nability in software development, data analysis and \\nproject management. Employers often prefer can -\\ndidates with engineering degrees. Starting criteria ',\n",
       " '26\\nPakistan Export Strategy 2023-2027 • SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\\nfor employability include basic technical skills, pro -\\nficiency in the English language and the relevant \\ndomain competencies. For information technology \\noutsourcing ( ITO ), software services companies \\nemploy IT graduates from Tier II and III universities, \\nwhile product development firms engage exclusively \\nwith Tier I universities. Although there is interaction \\nbetween the industry and universities, it does not \\nnecessarily result in effective pedagogical changes \\nthat represent emerging technology trends or mar -\\nket readiness of the graduating cohorts.\\n• In addition to the unemployability among some \\ncandidates, brain drain lowers the availability of ap -\\npropriate human capital and increases turnover. \\nEmployee turnover has a major impact on service \\nquality and delivery timelines. Local salaries can -\\nnot compare with the income Pakistani talent can \\ngenerate in the Middle East, United Kingdom and \\nUnited States. This results in good talent being de -\\nveloped in Pakistan, but then moving abroad for \\nhigher income and better lifestyles. This presents \\nan opportunity, as expats in markets like the United \\nStates have become a strategic asset for Pakistan’s \\noffshore services industry. For example, several \\nleading IT firms in Pakistan have been funded by \\nPakistani Americans.\\nAccess to capital for growth\\n• The access to finance for IT firms for growth is lim -\\nited, and most firms rely on financing by way of ex -\\nternal investment ( giving up equity ) or from friends \\nand family. Banks’ collateral requirements are not \\nfeasible to meet for most technology companies, \\nwhich have limited immovable assets. Collateral-\\nbased credit offerings by local banks prevents IT \\nfirms from generating liquidity to expand operations \\noutside Pakistan. IT firms have to generate capi -\\ntal by giving equity to foreign investors in order to \\nscale business outside Pakistan or set up a separate \\nlegal identity outside Pakistan and retain revenue \\nproceeds outside Pakistan. Obtaining capital by di -\\nvestment costs founders 20 %–40 % of equity.\\n• There are limited bank or government sector-specific \\nexport / project refinance facilities in the way they ex -\\nist for other industry sectors. Lack of working capi -\\ntal financing ( coupled with internal issues like poor \\ncash flow management ) creates payroll delays, \\nwhich increases employee dissatisfaction / turnover. \\nIn the medium term, problems with access to capital \\nalso affect firms’ ability to scale operations and their \\nengineering capabilities, which in turn limits the abil -\\nity to compete globally.• The Government has introduced schemes like ‘Ka -\\nmyab Jawan Scheme’ and other State Bank of Paki -\\nstan financing schemes to incentivize the IT sector. \\nWhile the FY 2021 budget’s SME financing facility of \\nup to PKR 5 million of non-collateralized loans was \\nwelcomed, there were concerns about the stream -\\nlined eligibility of IT firms and the administration of \\nthe facility to ensure better accessibility and dis -\\nbursement.\\nInadequate physical infrastructure\\n• In major cities such as Lahore and Islamabad, local \\nand foreign companies struggle to find office space \\naligned to international standards and requirements \\nof the services industry, at an affordable cost ; e.g. \\n24 / 7 availability, IT-ready infrastructure, reliable pow -\\ner and security. This constraint hinders the growth of \\nsmall IT product-based companies and freelancers, \\nwho lack affordable IT plug-and-play spaces (  e.g. \\nco-work ) to expand their business and / or provide \\nmore complex and sophisticated services. Rising \\nrent in metropolitan areas, especially in Karachi, \\nputs cost pressure on IT firms.\\n• Industry players assert that metropolitan rents are \\nhighest in Karachi, and are nearly 30-40% more than \\nLahore and Islamabad. This counts for almost 20 % \\nof an IT firm’s operating expenses. Additionally, rents \\nincrease at a rate of 10 % each year.\\n »Relevant activities in the PoA for supply-side and \\ninputs level : Talent – 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5, \\n2.1.6, 2.1.7, 2.2.1 and 2.2.2 ; Access to capital – \\n3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.2.3 ; Infrastructure – 4.1.3.\\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT LEVEL\\nSector recognition and tax treatment\\n• Industry stakeholders strongly assert that incon -\\nsistencies in tax treatment of the sector is hurting \\nthe predictability and growth plans of IT firms. As \\none industry leader noted, ‘It’s important to recog -\\nnize IT as a sector and growth / target-oriented tax \\nholidays’. In the government’s FY 2021 / 22 budget, \\nIT was recognized as an industry for the first time. \\nFurthermore, the Economic Advisory Council has \\ncreated a separate subcommittee on IT growth and \\ndigitization of the economy as recognition of the \\ngrowth potential in the industry. Industry stakehold -\\ners assert that, if the textile industry is given reduced \\nminimum turnover tax at 1.5 % instead of 3 %, the IT \\nindustry too – having been recognized as focused ',\n",
       " '27\\n SERVICE  MAP  AND  COMPETITIVENESS  DIAGNOSTIC  \\nfor growth – should be given the same minimum \\nturnover tax rate. While this is a contentious propo -\\nsition due to various socioeconomic and historical \\nconsiderations, policymakers would need to seri -\\nously consider the tax treatment of this sector given \\nits high net export earning status and potential for \\nhigh-income job creation.\\n• The sector recognition also has an implication for \\nallocations under government-supporting financing, \\nfor example, in getting a greater allocation of the Ex -\\nport Development Fund and the SME financing and \\nexport rebate, as enjoyed by other export sectors.\\n• Recently, the tax exemption regime has been con -\\nverted to tax credit for software exports, which \\nopens the door for onerous documentation and \\nharassment by tax authorities. Previously, the ex -\\nport of IT and IT-enabled services was exempt from \\nincome tax up to 30 June 2025. The Taxes ( Sec-\\nond Amendment  ) Ordinance 2021 dated 24 March \\n2021 replaced this exemption with a tax credit equal \\nto 100 % of the tax liability, subject to certain con -\\nditions. Additionally, the scope of services entitled \\nto tax credit has been enhanced to include cloud \\ncomputing and data storage services. However, \\nwhere such credit is not claimable (  such as due to \\nnon-compliance with any condition requisite  ), the \\nreceipts from exports are proposed to be taxed at \\n1 %, bringing them on par with the export of goods.\\n• Onerous tax documentation is often cited as a bot -\\ntleneck for firms in the industry, exacerbated by this \\nnew tax credit regime. Exemption qualification re -\\nquires onerous documentation to get exemption and \\nprocess export remittances into Pakistan. Start-ups, \\ntoo, face similar issues. Start-ups are exempt from \\nwithholding tax for five years under the Income Tax \\nOrdinance. The procedure for getting the exemption \\nand renewing it every year is cumbersome and cre -\\nates an environment of friction and exploitation with \\nthe tax authorities.\\n• Further, export of IT and IT-enabled services from \\nIslamabad is zero rated as against its current status \\nof being exempt. This will entitle a service provider to \\nclaim a refund for any input sales tax paid on goods \\nand services acquired. This will be relevant only to \\nexporters based in Islamabad, as IT services ren -\\ndered in provinces are subject to provincial sales tax \\nlaws, after the 18th Constitutional Amendment. The \\nprovincial differences in tax treatment would also \\nneed closer inspection to streamline and ensure that \\nan overall conducive climate across the country is \\ncreated for the IT exports industry to thrive.\\n8.– Travel advisory updated on 16 June 2021. Accessed at https:// travel.state.gov / content / travel / en / traveladvisories / traveladvisories / pakistan-\\ntravel-advisory.html .Risk perception and investor attractiveness\\nPakistan is generally perceived as a high-risk invest -\\nment proposition, particularly by US firms, which are \\nthe largest IT services importers. The United States De -\\npartment of State rated Pakistan with the Advisory Lev -\\nel 38 ( i.e. ‘reconsider travelling’ ), pinpointing terrorism \\nand sectarian violence as the main reasons. Similarly, \\nthe ‘political stability and absence of violence  / terror -\\nism’ index from the World Bank’s World Governance \\nIndicators ranks Pakistan at 125 out of a total of 126 \\ncountries.\\n• It is widely acknowledged in the industry that na -\\ntional security and political stability have a direct in -\\nfluence on the attractiveness and trust in Pakistan as \\nan IT exporter. As an industry leader noted, ‘Continu -\\nous government reform / policy irrespective of politi -\\ncal changes will create the trust foreign capital and \\nforeign buyers seek to invest in Pakistan and import \\nIT services from Pakistan’.\\n »Relevant activities in the PoA for business envi -\\nronment : Tax treatment – 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 ; Investor \\nattractiveness – 1.1.1, 1.1.2, 1.1.3, 4.1.1 and 4.2.2.\\nMARKET ACCESS LEVEL\\nInadequate market intelligence and \\ninternational marketing / branding\\n• Pakistan has not developed a concerted interna -\\ntional marketing strategy to effectively position itself \\nas an attractive and competitive offshore services \\ndestination. Consular staff around the world are not \\ntrained to identify or facilitate opportunities for Paki -\\nstani IT firms, and there is no formalized process for \\nIT firms to access Pakistani missions abroad to fa -\\ncilitate business promotion or drive country-specific \\nIT export targets.\\n• There is also a lack of research and market insight \\nto inform expansion into new markets. Often, Paki -\\nstani IT exports are limited to where the Pakistani \\ndiaspora resides and thus assist in getting market \\naccess. IT firms have less visibility into opportunities \\nin countries where Pakistani diaspora does not exist.',\n",
       " '28\\nPakistan Export Strategy 2023-2027 • SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\\nCapabilities for product quality, diversification \\nand innovation\\n• The lack of strong internal capabilities in some \\nsecond-tier firms for quality and delivery, including \\nadvanced project management, business analysis, \\ndata and cybersecurity, legal  / international contracts \\nand IT operation best practices can hold back their \\ninternational competitiveness. International process \\nand quality certifications should be strengthened \\nin order to enhance service delivery and ensure no \\nbreaches of service level agreements and loss of \\ncontracts.\\n• Pakistani companies need to strengthen their in -\\nnovation capabilities to develop IP-driven products, \\nmoving up from currently performing bespoke / cus-\\ntomization services on existing platforms and soft -\\nware made in the United States, Europe and other \\nmarkets. The current product portfolio is largely be -\\nspoke software development rather than product or \\nplatform development. Moreover, companies focus \\non winning big contracts with high margins rather \\nthan investing in or building sustainable products \\nthat can scale to different countries.\\n• A complementary aspect to upgrading to product \\ndevelopment should be strengthening intellectual \\nproperty. While the Intellectual Property Organization \\nAct exists, the process of trademark and intellectual \\nproperty registration is lengthy ( reports of some re -\\nsponse times as long as one year ). Moreover, there \\nis no section within the Intellectual Property Organi -\\nzation for software patent registration and protec -\\ntion, and the organization is in its nascent stages \\nand lacks efficiency and effectiveness in intellectual \\nproperty protection.Competition from government IT departments\\n• A persistent challenge faced by Pakistani IT firms \\nis the competition for IT services from public sector \\nentities, which have internal IT departments and / or \\ndrive digitization efforts. NADRA Technologies Lim -\\nited ( NTL ), Pakistan Revenue Automation ( Pvt ) Ltd \\n( PRAL  ), the Punjab Information Technology Board, \\nthe National Information Technology Board (  NITB  ), \\nthe National Logistics Cell (  NLC ) and the National \\nRadio & Telecommunication Corporation (  NRTC  ) \\nare all public sector-owned institutions set up to \\ndigitize essential government services as in-sourced \\nsoftware companies. However, they are highly con -\\nstrained by their speed to market, lack of innovation, \\nresource constraints, below-market pay scale, out -\\ndated management style and poor customer sup -\\nport operations, which limit their ability to respond \\nwith the agility required.\\n• In contrast, private IT firms are innovative, lean and \\nfollow emerging technology trends, but unfortunately \\ncannot compete with large government-owned IT \\nfirms. Consequently, they do not get the opportu -\\nnity to develop government technology ( GovTech ) \\nexperience and other eGovernment software devel -\\nopment initiatives, which could help them to build \\na portfolio and then bid for international tenders in \\nother countries. In cases where government projects \\nare open to the private sector, preconditions for bids \\ninvolve a certain size and experience that only a few \\nprivate IT firms can meet.\\n• The government would need to consider options for \\nencouraging domestic players to participate in the \\ngovernment digitization market, and also streamline \\nprocurement rules to encourage new players.\\n »Relevant activities in the PoA for market access \\nlevel : Market intel and global marketing – 1.1.1, \\n1.1.2, 1.1.3, 1.1.4, 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 1.2.3, 1.2.4 and 1.2.5  ; \\nProduct innovation and diversification – 4.1.2, \\n4.2.1, 4.2.2, 4.2.3 and 4.2.5 ; Government busi -\\nness – 4.2.5.\\nBy solving some of the key competitiveness \\nand growth constraints, Pakistan’s IT sector \\nand its software firms can position strongly \\nfor export growth.

Pa -\\nkistan should aim to reduce the overdependence (  of \\nmore than 50  % ) of its revenue arising from a single \\nmarket. Other regions such as the Middle East and \\nNorth Africa, Europe and Scandinavia and Asia–Pacific \\nhave a growing need for IT products and services, and \\nwould be of interest for Pakistan’s market diversification efforts.

Pakistan \\nhouses a few European multinational corporations \\nsuch as Telenor, Jotun, Nestle, Unilever, Ecolean, Stan -\\ndard Chartered, GlaxoSmithKline and British American \\nTobacco, etc. The industry can push to set up global \\nin-house centres (  GICs  ) of these companies that have not set up in Pakistan already, and advocate for their \\nregional presence to be based out of Pakistan. For ex -\\nample, in India, the offshoring industry got their initial \\nboost through multinational corporations that offshore \\ntheir onshore requirements first, and then offshore \\nrequirements to Indian companies and workforce.\\nFigure 19 :  ICT spending growth rate YoY\\nSource : IDC Worldwide Black Book : Live Edition, May 2021.\\nAsia–Pacific : Asia is home to half of the world’s 3.2 \\nbillion population and, by 2030, Asia will be home to \\n65 % of the global middle class and will account for \\n40 % of global consumption. Asia currently accounts for \\nhalf of the world’s 2.2 billion internet users. According \\nto the IDC ( April 2021  ), ICT spending in the region was \\npredicted to grow by more than 4.9 % to reach $924 bil -\\nlion in 2021 and is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2024. \\nDue to the disruption to working models ( for example, \\nwork from anywhere policies ), a surge in spend for \\ndevices, cybersecurity and user experience, it is likely \\nthat cloud-based services will dominate in months and \\nyears to come. As per Gartner, mature countries in the \\nregion such as Singapore, the Republic of Korea, Aus -\\ntralia and New Zealand were projected to spend $174 \\nbillion, while China, Hong Kong and Chinese Taipei \\nwere expected to spend $498 billion in 2021.\\nParticipants also identified certain risks in the existing \\nand future market orientation mix, for example  : Market \\nsaturation in the United States ; thin profitability, low val -\\nue and high competition in Gulf and African markets ; \\nissues with foreign policy and consequently travel and \\nvisas in some target markets.The analysis above describes the potential of regions \\nother than the United States.

Large \\nenterprises globally are using advanced analytics for \\nforecasting, data mining, machine learning, learning \\npatterns, semantic analysis, sentiment analysis and \\nsimulation, etc. Leading enterprise solutions have \\nincluded advanced analytics into their mainstream \\nproducts such as supply chain solutions, customer \\nrelationship management ( CRM ) and human resourc -\\nes ( HR ), to name a few. Existing trends have been \\nsomewhat disrupted due to COVID-19 and historical \\ndata that reflects past conditions is quickly becoming \\nobsolete. Consequently, there is now a shift from ‘big \\ndata’ to ‘small and wide data’, with Gartner predict -\\ning that, by 2025, 70 % of organizations will make this \\nshift, providing more context for analytics and mak -\\ning AI less ‘data hungry’. Services for analytics and \\ndata gathered through AI could be a novel offering by Pakistan software houses.

Further, help desk \\nand support services should focus on more complex \\nproblem-solving services than just first-level services. \\nHuman resources need to be oriented towards new \\nskills in cybersecurity, data analytics and AI as well as \\nin higher-order skills (  such as competencies for prob -\\nlem-solving rather than mere transactional-level en -\\ngagement ). Additionally, investing in creating a robust \\ntalent pipeline in these new industries and technologies \\nwill be essential, and the strategy’s PoA includes some \\nactivities specifically for this purpose.\\nIn summary, Orientation 2 would have the following implications for the strategy :\\n• Investments  : Attracting FDI that will support Pa -\\nkistan’s entry into these new industries and tech -\\nnologies ( see Activity 4.1.1 in PoA ) ; investments \\nthat build internal capabilities for innovation, im -\\nproving quality and product upgrading to latch \\non to emerging technologies and industries (  see \\nActivities 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 in PoA ).\\n• Institutional  : Updating IP protection, data priva -\\ncy and other laws that make Pakistan attractive \\nto these new industries that will be increasingly more discerning of issues like cybersecurity and \\nproduct IP ( see Activities 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 ).\\n• Skills  : Building up the overall talent pool and \\nthe specialized technical skilled workforce that \\nis better suited to these new technology trends, \\nas well as to enhance delivery excellence (  see \\nActivities 2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, 2.1.4, 2.1.5 and 2.2.2 \\nin PoA  ) ; strengthening internal product portfo -\\nlios aligned to the growing technologies and in -\\ndustries discussed above ( see Activity 1.2.4 in  \\nthe PoA ).\\nORIENTATION 3  :  \\nFOCUS ON KEY TRANSFORMATION \\nAREAS FOR THE SECTOR\\nThis orientation is about focusing on three key transfor -\\nmation areas for the sector, namely user experience, \\nenhancing women’s participation in the sector, and \\nbuilding up international giants and IP-driven growth.Focus and strategies\\nFocus on user experience and quality\\nCompanies and governments have started using \\ncustomer experience and user experience to make a \\ndifference and to have a competitive advantage.

According \\nto global forecasts, 62 % and 60  % of investments in \\nIT are expected to be in user experience and quality \\nassurance respectively in the coming years ( CompTIA \\nIndustry Outlook 2021 ). Pakistani software firms that \\nfocus on improving the user experience of software \\nsolutions and are known for high quality in both prod -\\nucts and service delivery will be successful in interna -\\ntional markets.\\nFocus on women’s participation\\nAccording to available data, there is less than 15 % fe-\\nmale participation in the IT workforce ( much lower than \\nIndia’s 35  %, Brazil’s 40  % and the Philippines’ 60  % ), \\ndespite nearly 60  % female participation in IT education. \\nA safe working environment, reducing mobility restric -\\ntions and combating traditional gender roles is needed \\nto narrow this disparity. With the adoption of ‘work from \\nanywhere’, some constraints ( like work environments \\nand mobility restrictions  ) would increasingly not be \\nconstraints anymore. Having laid out policies for re -\\ncruitment encouraging women to join the IT workforce \\namong the leading IT firms would set precedence for \\nothers to follow. Industry association initiatives like P@\\nSHA’s Diversity and Inclusion Framework is an excel -\\nlent start. The government and the IT industry should \\nbring about favourable labour policy frameworks and \\nencourage organizations to recruit more women into \\nthe IT labour force.\\nFocus on building up giants and IP creation\\nThe industry needs to make 10 of the large IT BPM \\ncompanies become global leaders and have them \\nrecognized like India’s large software houses, such \\nas TATA Consultancy Services ( TCS ), Infosys and \\nTech Mahindra, etc. When the large become trans -\\nnational, the midsized companies eventually become \\nlarge, and the small become medium and up the lad -\\nder. FDI can help in this upgrading via joint ventures \\nand value chain funding, etc. The recent joint venture \\nbetween Samsung and Lucky Group to manufacture \\nSamsung mobile devices needs to be marketed to \\nshowcase Pakistan’s capabilities and to lure other \\nmultinational corporations in the technology sector, \\nspecifically in software. Pakistan needs to attract FDI \\nto help domestic firms grow, and look at IP creation \\nfor locally developed products and offer these on a \\nsoftware as a service ( SaaS ) basis, which is becoming \\nthe default choice globally. Nationally, the government \\ncan support increasing scale and also encourage \\nentry into new technologies by better enabling the \\nprivate sector to participate actively and fairly in new \\ngovernment digitalization programmes that enable experimentation, which can then be scaled up to offer \\ninternational commercial offerings. Leveraging public \\ninvestment for advancing private sector development \\nof new technologies is a popular strategy among \\nmany global IT hubs.\\nFocus on improving advanced technical capabilities \\nin emerging technologies\\nTechnologies currently seen as emerging, such as IoT, \\nAI, robotic process automation, autonomous vehicles, \\nmixed reality (  virtual reality and augmented reality  ), \\n5G, digital twins and voice interfaces, etc., would be \\nadapted to the mainstream in a year or two as the pace \\nof digital adaptation and transformation quickens. \\nWhile the industry has grown thus far with base level \\neducation and trained workers, advanced technical \\nskills are needed in order to latch on to these emerg -\\ning technologies and be able to be a strong global \\nplayer. These advanced skills are primarily developed \\nat tertiary level, particularly through university educa -\\ntion that rewards research and post-doctoral work. To \\nbuild a solid cohort of young people in these new tech -\\nnologies, there needs to be a sound knowledge and \\nresearch base. A targeted effort to build up domestic \\nacademic talent along with welcoming international \\n( including Pakistani diaspora ) talent will be required.  \\nInternal investments by firms – by allocating teams and \\nfunding pools – to explore and experiment on these \\ntechnologies can also help generate new ideas and \\nseek new profitability while not risking core growth  \\nand revenues.\\nRequired investments and skills\\nFor the above focus transformation areas, investments \\nwill be needed at both firm and national levels. At the \\nfirm level, investing in better workforce and human \\nresources frameworks that encourage and reward \\nquality and service excellence and encourage great -\\ner female participation and retention will be needed. \\nAt the national level, too, better labour market frame -\\nworks that not only build the pipeline of women with IT \\neducation, but also ensure conversion into software \\nsector employment and lowers attrition. Meanwhile, \\nfor building up giants and moving to IP-led growth, \\nfirm-level investments in scaling their business, ag -\\ngressively promoting in key growth markets, investing \\nin skills for international expansion and new product \\ndevelopment will be important. National-level initiatives \\nthat support and incentivize this trajectory – by way of \\nmatching grants, targeted and time-bound schemes, \\nand non-collateralized financing tools to help de-\\nrisk global expansion – would help firms accelerate  \\nthis shift.',\n",

Some of the comments \\nare mentioned below.\\n‘Stakeholders need to identify who will do what \\nwhen a final plan of action has been decided on. \\nWithout laying out clear roles and responsibilities, \\nwe might not get anywhere. All sectors will need to \\nwork together.’\\n‘While the strategy is comprehensive and looks \\ngood so far, the outcome can only be determined \\nas long as the stakeholders and their responsibilities \\nare clearly defined.’\\n‘One cannot rely on a single institution or the gov -\\nernment alone. The tasks need to be clear, and \\neveryone’s role needs to be assigned and cross-\\nchecked so it can be seen through. The industry \\nneeds support, the government is willing to provide it and, if assembled, applied and monitored prop -\\nerly, it will set us on the right track and enable the \\nindustry to achieve its true potential.’\\n‘It is imperative that [the strategy] lay great stress \\non meeting the timeline set for the laid-out goals. \\nDelays due to procedural issues and communica -\\ntion pipelines tend to make things less effective \\nand are a hindrance to implementation of rectifying \\nmeasures.’\\n‘It is imperative that stakeholders from both govern -\\nment and the private sector are involved in [the] \\nplan of action, because the implementation would \\nrequire equal effort from both sides.’\\nThe presence of the sector specific council to oversee \\nthe strategy’s implementation is a key success factor, \\nbut it is not sufficient to effectively fulfil its assigned \\nfunctions.\\nPrivate sector support and participation in \\nimplementation\\nThe private sector clearly expressed its willingness to \\ncontribute, directly or in partnership with public insti -\\ntutions, to the strategy’s implementation. Their imple -\\nmentation efforts can range from providing business \\nintelligence to institutions to contributing to project \\ndesign, promotion and branding, and policy advoca -\\ncy, etc. In brief, the private sector’s practical knowl -\\nedge of business operations is essential to ensuring \\nthat the strategy remains aligned to market trends and \\nopportunities.Proactive networking and communication\\nThe key implementing institutions detailed in the PoA \\nneed to be informed of the strategy’s content and the \\nimplications for their 2022–26 programming. This net -\\nworking and communication is essential to build further \\nownership and provide institutions with the opportunity \\nto confirm the activities they can implement in the short \\nto long term. It will be important for the TDAP, MoC and \\nmembers of the sector specific council to reach out to \\nrelevant institutions nationally to create awareness and \\nsupport for the development of the software services \\nindustry.\\nResources for implementation\\nThe sector specific council, in collaboration with \\nthe TDAP and the Secretariat at MoC, will need to \\nleverage additional support for efficient implementa -\\ntion. Effective planning and resource mobilization is ',\n",
       " '43\\n IMPLEMENTATION  FRAMEWORK  \\nindispensable in supporting strategy implementation. \\nResource mobilization should be carefully planned and \\norganized.\\nAs the software export industry is a priority sec -\\ntor strategy of the STPF, the Government of Pakistan \\nshould define annual budget allocations and support \\nto drive the industry’s growth. This commitment will \\ndemonstrate clear engagement towards strength -\\nening the sector and encourage private partners to \\nsupport development. In addition to national budget \\nsupport, resource identification will require the Board of Investment to effectively target foreign investors \\nin line with the strategy’s priorities. Investment flows \\nto Pakistan should also be considered as a valuable \\ndriver of strategy implementation and overall industry \\ndevelopment.\\nThe various implementation modalities detailed will \\ndetermine the success of the strategy’s implementa -\\ntion. However, high-level support from the government, \\nin collaboration with strong championship by the pri -\\nvate sector, will be the real driver of successful strategy \\nimplementation.\\nTo achieve the vision and strategic objectives discussed, a robust, actionable and realistic strategic plan of action \\n( PoA ) is required. This is provided in the section below, and constitutes the heart of this strategy.\\nThe PoA is structured along the four strategic objectives and the operational objectives described above. For each \\nobjective, the PoA outlines detailed activities and their implementation modalities, which include  :\\n• Priority level :  Priority 1 being the highest and 3 the lowest.\\n• Period : The desired time-frame of the activity.\\n• Reform or project  : Defines whether the activity entails a legal action.\\n• Targets  : Quantifiable targets that allow completion monitoring of the activity during the implementation stage.\\n• Leading implementing partners  : One single accountable lead institution per activity. ( The institution can also \\nhave a technical role or can solely have an oversight and coordination role. )\\n• Supporting implementing partners  : Any institution that should be involved at any stage of the activity’s im -\\nplementation.\\n©Pexels',\n",

Developing a compelling proposition will re -\\nquire a combination of internal stakeholder discussions \\nto home in on the unique elements that partners would \\nfind competitive, coupled with expert input from out -\\nside that helps sense check and refine, them. While the \\nbrand must primarily be articulated by the industry, as \\nit must have strong commercial relevance, the exercise \\nmust have public sector input and ownership as well in \\norder to ensure longevity and credibility.\\n1.1.2 Develop media collaterals and launch publicity \\ncampaign to promote the brand and develop mar -\\nketing materials ( featuring Pakistan’s software capa -\\nbilities, sector development initiatives and incentives, \\nand top business profiles / case studies of success ), \\nand branding guidelines based on the above identi -\\nfied brand positioning, to be used for all domestic and \\ninternational industry events.\\nAccording to the brand positioning developed, it is \\nimportant to have strong media collaterals developed, \\nwhich will be used by all industry stakeholders in their \\ndaily dealings with partners as well as in international \\nexpansion efforts ( like trade fairs and business-to-busi -\\nness meetings  ). Government agencies ( Ministry of Foreign Affairs, etc. ) should use the media collaterals \\ndeveloped. All this is to ensure consistency in branding \\nand grow recognizability among international partners. \\nA mix of media outputs need to be developed – rang -\\ning from trade fair stall guidelines to case study and \\npromotional videos, to logos free to use by all industry \\nplayers in their communications, and an active virtual \\npresence ( website and social media ).\\n1.1.3 Train Pakistan’s commercial counsellors in over -\\nseas diplomatic missions on the new brand position -\\ning, conduct information sessions and identify priority \\ncountries on which to work.\\nIn order to leverage the extensive network of Pakistani \\ndiplomats in key focus countries, commercial counsel -\\nlors would be trained in the sector’s new orientation as \\nper this strategy, the new sector branding developed \\nand what it encompasses, as well as focus segments \\nand markets that the industry wishes to target. When \\nnew diplomats are nominated, and prior to their taking \\nup posting abroad, they should receive a briefing from \\nthe industry. As such, commercial counsellors would \\nbecome much more adept at advocating for the sec -\\ntor’s investment and business partnerships abroad, \\nusing credible and compelling materials and armed \\nwith the right facts and positioning. Such training can \\nbe conducted by the industry association, in partner -\\nship with the key trade and foreign affairs authorities.\\n1.1.4 Identify and participate in the most relevant IT \\nsector international  fairs and business-to-business \\nopportunities (  initially virtually  )\\nTrade fairs will remain an important element in interna -\\ntional business promotion of the industry, albeit a great -\\ner virtual presence during the pandemic. Government \\nauthorities involved in trade and investment promotion \\nshould partner with the private sector to identify the \\nmost relevant and useful fairs and business-to-busi -\\nness opportunities – especially those that match the \\nnew orientations set out in this strategy. They should \\nalso help meet the targeted growth objectives ( e.g. in \\nthe new emerging technologies or in the new markets \\nprioritized  ), and facilitate participation in them. A spe -\\ncial focus on SME players in the industry is important \\nto ensure that those otherwise unable to participate in \\nsuch opportunities also get a fair chance. Government ',\n",

Typically, \\nthis analysis would be done by organizations like the \\nPSEB, in partnership with P@SHA, with support from \\nexternal sources ( including foreign missions ). These \\nanalyses should inform the basis of firms’ international \\nexpansion strategies and internal resource allocations. \\nThis would be particularly useful for SMEs in the sector, \\nwho have limited resources to undertake exploration, \\nand can help ensure resource efficiency. In the five-\\nyear period of the strategy, ideally, the majority of firms \\nin the sector would have used, or at least referenced, \\nsuch detailed analysis in deciding their own internation -\\nal expansion and market exploration.\\n1.2.2 Develop detailed market entry plan for the MENA \\nregion, including specific approach on how to break \\ninto identified specific markets, regulatory condi -\\ntions, listing of potential partners and holding busi -\\nness-to-business meetings, etc.\\n1.2.3 Develop detailed market entry plan for the Asia–\\nPacific region, including a specific approach on how \\nto break into identified specific markets, regulatory \\nconditions, listing of potential partners and holding \\nbusiness-to-business matchmaking, etc.\\nThe two activities relating to detailed market entry \\nplans for MENA and Asia–Pacific are indicative only, \\nand could include other markets as well. Essentially, \\nbased on the deep-dive priority market and potential \\nanalysis conducted as per Activity 1.2.1, step-by-step \\nmarket entry plans would be developed to guide firms \\nlooking to enter these regions and markets. Typical -\\nly, such plans would include pre-competitive details \\nlike regulatory procedures, how to navigate entry and \\nlisting of potential partners, etc. The objective of such \\nplans would be to de-risk as much as possible the new \\nmarket entry efforts, and ensure maximum chances of \\nsuccess for firms.1.2.4 Conduct capacity-building programme for firms \\nto review and refine their product portfolio and internal \\ngo-to-market strategies to identified market opportuni -\\nties ( as per 1.2.1, 1.2.2 and 1.2.3 ).\\nRefining product portfolios and strengthening go-to-\\nmarket strategies – especially to new markets – can \\noften be done by a specialized skill. Some products \\nmay be relevant to some markets more than others, \\nwhile some market entry strategies would be better \\nsuited to some markets more than others. Accordingly, \\nthis activity envisages providing capacity building to \\nsupport firms to do that, delivered by experts as well \\nas through peer learning. Once again, the purpose \\nhere is to de-risk as much as possible the new market \\nentry efforts and ensure maximum chances of suc -\\ncess for firms.\\n1.2.5 Improve capabilities in key government agencies \\n( e.g. TDAP and PSEB ) to promote the software sector \\n( including in conducting and providing market intelli -\\ngence to the sector, how to identify and support forging \\nbusiness-to-business linkages and other partners for \\nsector growth, in collaboration with sector association ).\\nWhile one-off market identification is done upfront, it \\nis vital to build capabilities in the system to continually \\nconduct such assessments in order to regularly pro -\\nvide the industry with guidance and updates on shifts \\nin existing markets and trends in new ones. This market \\nintelligence typically has ‘public good’ characteristics \\nin that no individual firm may be willing to pay for it, and \\nas such the leading government trade support institu -\\ntions need to provide it.\\nIMPROVE TALENT AVAILABILITY FOR \\nGROWTH AND COMPETITIVENESS\\nOperational Objective 2.1  : Increase the talent \\npipeline for software firms and enhance \\ninclusion\\n2.1.1 Expand provision of IT skills through existing ter -\\ntiary institutions and IT vocational schools to introduce \\ndedicated software sector-relevant programmes.\\n2.1.2 Introduce short-term conversion courses for ter -\\ntiary graduates of other subjects to transition to the \\nIT sector and obtain the required skills and become \\nemployable.\\n2.1.3 Establish a programme to place university grad -\\nuates into IT firms, including expansion of internships. \\nAnnounce a ‘1,000 internship’ programme and obtain ',\n",
       " '65\\n ANNEX ES \\ncommitment from at least 20 software firms to accom -\\nmodate 10 interns a year and conduct outreach in the \\nprovinces to on-board candidates.\\nThe purpose of the above three activities is to grow \\nthe talent pipeline available to support the sector’s \\nfuture growth ambitions. It is often the case that ambi -\\ntious growth goals become constrained by the lack of \\navailable skills, and planning now and building up the \\ncapacities early can help avert a crisis later. IT tertiary \\neducation provision through all channels needs to be \\nincreased, while supplementing and complementing \\nwith vocational training as well as skills development. \\nEspecially for the industry’s planned shift to high -\\ner-value-added business, simple skills development \\nwould not be sufficient, and a concerted effort to grow \\nIT tertiary education numbers is vital. In order to ad -\\ndress short – to medium-term constraints, introducing \\nhigh-impact conversion courses for those who study \\nother disciplines to enter the industry can be very use -\\nful. Meanwhile, introducing well-structured internship \\nprogrammes can not only help provide an additional \\nentry point for young graduates ( with lower commit -\\nments from firms ), but can also help bridge the em -\\nployability gap.\\n2.1.4 Conduct and publicize a skills survey on emerging \\nskill requirements of software firms in order to reduce \\nskills mismatch, inform youth education choices and \\ninfluence tertiary institutions’ curriculum, and provide \\ncontinual industry guidance / input on the curriculum to \\nensure industry relevance and employability.\\nIt is important for the industry to signal to education -\\nal institutions as well as young job seekers as to the \\nemerging skill requirements and demands in the IT \\nsector. Accordingly, a popular tool is to conduct a \\nskills survey generated by the industry and use that to \\nspread wide awareness on the industry’s needs. Ad -\\nditionally, to ensure continual alignment and realign -\\nment to industry needs, this skills survey needs to be \\nconducted periodically and engage industry leaders in \\nshaping IT curriculum in tertiary institutions.\\n2.1.5 Engage selected suitable tertiary education in -\\nstitutions to introduce new courses aimed at building \\nthe talent pool for emerging technology opportunities \\n( e.g. in AI, machine learning, big data, cybersecurity, \\nrobotics, and IoT, etc.\\nAs one of the industry’s main medium-term objectives \\nis to upgrade its product offering by latching on to \\nemerging technologies (  ref : Orientation 3 earlier  ), it \\nis vital that the necessary skilled talent pool is devel -\\noped. Unlike simple re-skilling or upskilling, working on emerging technologies requires core competencies \\ntaught in tertiary institutions, as well as proliferation of \\nresearch and post-doctoral work. New courses in ter -\\ntiary education institutions, built up with industry input \\nand global expertise, will be vital. Public funding for \\nnew degree programmes and departments should \\nalso be considered.\\n2.1.6 Introduce a special programme to enhance wom -\\nen’s participation in the software sector by spreading \\nawareness of career opportunities in the sector, show -\\ncasing female role models in the sector and improv -\\ning internal systems to foster a female-friendly work \\nenvironment.\\nA key transformation area identified for the sector’s \\nsustainable growth is enhancing women’s participa -\\ntion. This is unlikely to entirely happen organically, and \\nneeds support and incentives. This activity envisages \\nembarking on a special and targeted programme – a \\nmulti-pronged approach – to not only spread aware -\\nness of entry points and career opportunities for \\nwomen, but to also showcase female role models and \\nimprove internal human resources practices that favour \\nwomen’s participation. P@SHA’s work on publishing a \\n‘Diversity and Inclusion Framework’ serves as a strong \\nfoundation from which to build.\\n2.1.7 Conduct provincial-level awareness-raising ses -\\nsions for school-going youth on high-potential career \\nopportunities in the software sector, so as to expand \\nthe pipeline of available talent at an early stage.\\nOften, young people away from the main cities may \\nnot always know of the opportunities in the sector or \\nknow of the entry points to get in. This activity is similar \\nand linked to 2.1.4 above, but with an explicit focus \\non provincial job creation and ensuring greater geo -\\ngraphical inclusion of the IT workforce. In particular, \\nthis recognizes the strong multiplier effects of IT worker \\nincomes and the role it can play in improving house -\\nhold prosperity in provincial economies.\\nOperational Objective 2.2  : Improve internal \\nskill capabilities for export business growth  .\\n2.2.1 Introduce / expand training to improve soft skills \\nof employees in software firms ( e.g. negotiation, com -\\nmunication and interpersonal skills  ), especially among \\nthe business development, prospecting, marketing and \\nclient engagement teams.\\n2.2.2 Introduce training programmes to upgrade \\nproject management capabilities ( Scrum, the Infor -\\nmation Technology Infrastructure Library and project ',\n",

As the industry evolves and new \\nclients are on-boarded from existing and new markets, \\nthe pressure to perform and delivery high quality and \\nreliability becomes a key success factor. Accordingly, \\nimproving skills within the firms to deal better with cli -\\nents and improve delivery projects to clients becomes \\nimportant.

Often, \\ntax authorities do not understand the sector well, given \\nthe different business models and operating modali -\\nties compared to other sectors – this leads to tensions, \\npoorly designed tax administration frameworks and \\nweakened compliance.\\nOperational Objective 3.2  : Improve access  \\nto capital for software firms\\n3.2.1 Introduce project financing windows (  including \\ngovernment refinancing facilities ) for software firms to \\nenable international market expansion.3.2.2 Federal financial sector authorities and banks to \\ncollectively identify and develop new loan products and \\nlending modalities to suit software export business.\\n3.2.3. Improve banks’ internal credit scoring and credit \\nappraisal of software businesses.\\nAs noted in the constraints analysis section, firms in \\nthe software export sector find it hard to obtain growth \\ncapital and existing financing modes are not suitable \\nor are unappealing. The above activities are aimed \\nat addressing that through a mix of introducing new \\nproducts and procedures and improving bank lending \\nprinciples (  through better credit scoring ). It is expected \\nthat, in time, the sector will have little difficulty in ac -\\ncessing debt capital, whether it is to finance working \\ncapital needs or to finance international expansion. \\nWhile software firms may continue to seek equity cap -\\nital for particular needs, it is important to ensure that \\nthe channel of debt capital always remains open and \\neasy, so that entrepreneurs have multiple sources of \\nfinancing to use as needed and as suited for the pur -\\npose and the stage of the businesses’ growth.\\nSTRENGTHEN INNOVATION AND \\nUPGRADING IN THE SOFTWARE SECTOR\\nOperational Objective 4.1  : Encourage new \\ninvestment in the sector and start-ups\\n4.1.1 Launch a time-bound investment promotion effort \\nto attract FDI into the software sector, with focused at -\\ntention on market segments that Pakistan desires up -\\ngrading into and building positioning in.\\nA key determinant of the Pakistani software sector’s \\nupgrading and enhanced competitiveness and ag -\\ngressive new market entry would be attracting new and \\ngood-quality FDI. Given the tight competition for FDI \\nattraction, as well as domestic issues in FDI facilitation, \\nPakistan needs to launch a focused investment promo -\\ntion effort in a targeted and time-bound manner. Such \\nan effort would require public resources to be allocated \\nand disbursed in a timely manner ( to finance the FDI \\npromotion programme  ), proactive engagement by the \\nprivate sector ( including advocacy by existing foreign \\ninvestors located in Pakistan ), support of Pakistan’s \\ninternational diplomatic missions and alignment with \\nkey agencies involved in investor facilitation.\\n4.1.2 Assess current ecosystem for software start-ups \\nand introduce a time-bound and focused programme \\nto address bottlenecks and launch a ‘1,000 start-ups’ ',\n",

New entrepreneurship is also a key \\ncontributor to innovation in the sector. Accordingly, \\nsupporting the start-up ecosystem becomes important. \\nThis activity is aimed at introducing a time-bound effort \\nto rapidly remove bottlenecks for start-ups and create \\na more favourable climate for start-up entrepreneurship \\nin the software exports sector. This also recognizes that \\nnew export revenue growth doesn’t only come from \\nlarger firms, but also from the establishment of new \\nfirms, exporting from day one ( ‘born global’ ) or starting \\nwith domestic clients and then moving to exports. The \\nsecond activity here also recognizes that smaller firms \\nface greater challenges in the early years of operations \\n– especially around cost pressures and profitability – \\nand, as such, require some initial nurturing by way of \\nmaking operating expenses like rent more affordable \\nfor an initial period.\\nOperational Objective 4.2  : Improve enabling \\nframework for product-led innovation\\n4.2.1 Update intellectual property protection frame -\\nworks and their implementation to protect Pakistani \\nsoftware product innovation and encourage IP-led \\ngrowth in the sector.\\n4.2.2 Align data protection, information security and \\nprivacy laws to global best practices to build trust in \\nPakistani IT as a brand and ensure that Pakistani soft -\\nware firms win and retain business from customers \\nin countries that have increasingly tighter laws and \\nheightened information security concerns.\\nThe above two activities are aimed at introducing ( or \\nstrengthening existing ) legal and regulatory frame -\\nworks that position Pakistan more strongly for prod -\\nuct-led growth in the sector, which is a key focus of \\nthis five-year strategy. With the growing global atten -\\ntion on intellectual property, data protection and pri -\\nvacy rules, Pakistan needs to introduce new, or align \\nexisting, national rules to global rules and trends. This \\nwill become a prerequisite for the sector’s global ex -\\npansion goals.4.2.3 Introduce a targeted export incentive scheme \\nfor software firms that build and sell ( globally ) IP-led \\nsoftware products ( and move on from customized \\nsoftware service provision ) to encourage moving up \\nvalue chain.\\nAs a way to encourage and accelerate product-led \\ngrowth in the short to medium term, this activity envis -\\nages introducing a time-bound and focused export in -\\ncentive scheme for firms that move up the value chain \\nthrough a product-led approach. This incentive would \\naim to signal to the industry as to the desired trajectory \\nto be pursued and also make it financially attractive. \\nThe mechanics of such an incentive scheme would \\nneed to be carefully devised ( in close consultation with \\nthe private sector  ) to ensure that it is feasible to comply \\nand no perverse incentives are created. It should also \\nbe periodically monitored to ensure that the desired \\npolicy goals are being met.\\n4.2.4 In order to help build product portfolio and \\nstrengthen export potential, ensure that Pakistani soft -\\nware firms have equitable access to government IT \\nprojects by levelling the playing field with internal IT \\ndepartments and simplifying preconditions  / enabling \\nconditions in bids. Consider carving out certain proj -\\nects ( by types / size ) exclusively for private sector play -\\ners to foster innovation.\\nAs noted in the constraints analysis section, industry \\nstakeholders felt quite strongly about the problems \\nin private sector opportunities to tap into government \\nIT projects. This activity envisages creating a more \\nlevel playing field and will perhaps require a gradual \\napproach. A useful low-hanging fruit is to rewrite pro -\\ncurement rules to better enable, and increase procure -\\nment pipeline visibility, for the domestic private sector \\nto participate in such projects.\\n4.2.5 Establish collaboration with innovation ecosys -\\ntems in friendly countries and connect Pakistan’s tech \\necosystem to accelerate product-led growth and inno -\\nvation of Pakistani software start-ups and SMEs.\\nWith a view to globalizing Pakistan’s software eco -\\nsystem and enabling greater exposure for Pakistani \\nstart-ups and SMEs, twinning the country with other \\ninnovation ecosystems (  e.g. through forging memoran -\\ndums of understanding between industry associations \\nand between apex ICT agencies, and partnerships be -\\ntween angel / venture capital networks, etc. ). First steps \\ncan be made with countries with which Pakistan has \\nbilateral trade and investment, comprehensive partner -\\nship or bilateral dialogue agreements.',\n",
